# Data Ingestion

Our data ingestion layer is responsible for bringing data from various source systems into the Unified Data Platform (UDP).

## Overview

The ingestion process involves:
1. **Extraction**: Retrieving data from source systems.
2. **Landing**: Storing raw data in a secure, scalable landing zone.
3. **Validation**: Ensuring data quality and integrity.

## Supported Sources

- **Evolve**: Core administrative data.
- **TAS**: Transactional accounting system.
- **Compass**: Operational data.
- **Gatekeeper**: Security and access logs.
- **Trust Architect**: Architectural metadata.
- **Composer**: Orchestration metadata.

## Ingestion Patterns

### Batch Processing
Scheduled data transfers for large volumes of historical data.

### Real-time Streaming
Near-instantaneous data ingestion for critical business monitoring.
