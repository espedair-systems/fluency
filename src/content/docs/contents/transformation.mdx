# Data Transformation

The transformation layer is where raw data is processed, cleaned, and modeled into the Data Vault and Business Consumption models.

## Key Concepts

- **Raw Data Vault**: Captures the history of data from source systems.
- **Business Vault**: Applies business logic and rules to raw data.
- **Consumption Models**: Optimized structures for reporting and analysis.
