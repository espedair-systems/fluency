# Business Vault

The Business Vault applies business logic, calculations, and rules to the data held in the Raw Vault.

## Key Components

- **Business Hubs/Links/Satellites**: Derived structures based on business rules.
- **Point-in-Time (PIT) Tables**: Optimized for performance and historical state reporting.
- **Bridge Tables**: Simplified many-to-many relationships for easier querying.

## Principles

- **Derived Data**: Built on top of the Raw Vault.
- **Business Logic**: Centralized repository for complex business definitions.
- **Performance**: Designed to support efficient consumption layer builds.
