# Data Canvas Reference

The Data Canvas is an interactive, visual environment for exploring, modeling, and transforming your data in Fluency.

## Overview

Data Canvas allows you to visualize the relationships between your data sources and design transformations using a nodes-and-edges interface.

## Key Features

- **Visual Modeling**: Map out your data architecture with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- **Real-time Preview**: See the results of your transformations instantly.
- **Collaboration**: Share your canvas with team members for collective data design.

## How to Access

You can access the Data Canvas from the primary navigation menu or by selecting a data source and clicking "Edit in Canvas".

### Working with Nodes

- **Source Nodes**: Represent your raw data files or databases (e.g., BigQuery, local CSVs).
- **Transform Nodes**: Apply logic like filters, joins, or aggregations.
- **Output Nodes**: Define where the final processed data should be stored.
