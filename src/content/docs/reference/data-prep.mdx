# Data Prep Reference

Data Prep is the dedicated environment for cleaning, formatting, and normalizing your raw data before it enters the transformation pipeline.

## Overview

High-quality insights require high-quality data. Data Prep provides the tools to handle missing values, standardize formats, and resolve schema inconsistencies.

## Key Features

- **Smart Cleaning**: Automated suggestions for fixing common data issues like date formats or capitalization.
- **De-duplication**: Identify and merge duplicate records across different sources.
- **Join & Union**: Combine disparate datasets with an intuitive visual interface.
- **Validation Rules**: Set mandatory constraints to ensure data integrity.

## Common Workflows

### Standardizing Formats
Ensure all currency, date, and unit fields follow a consistent global standard across your entire workspace.

### Handling Null Values
Define strategies for missing data, such as filling with defaults, using statistical means, or flagging records for manual review.

### Schema Mapping
Align source data fields with your internal target schema to ensure seamless integration.

## Integration

Data Prep acts as the gateway between **Ingestion** and the **Data Canvas**. Cleaned data is saved as a "Prepped Asset," which can then be used in any modeling or analysis session.
