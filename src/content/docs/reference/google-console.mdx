# Google Cloud Console Reference

The Google Cloud Console is the administrative interface for managing the underlying resources that power your Fluency environment, including data storage, AI models, and security settings.

## Overview

While most day-to-day operations are handled within Fluency, the Google Cloud Console is used for initial setup, billing management, and advanced resource monitoring.

## Key Management Areas

### IAM & Admin
Manage permissions, service accounts, and API keys. This is where you grant Fluency the necessary roles to access your data.
- **Service Accounts**: Create and manage the identities Fluency uses to interact with GCP APIs.
- **Roles**: Assign `BigQuery Admin`, `Vertex AI User`, and other required permissions.

### APIs & Services
Enable the specific Google Cloud services required by Fluency:
- **BigQuery API**
- **Vertex AI API**
- **Cloud Storage API**

### Monitoring & Logging
Track the performance and health of your data pipelines.
- **Cloud Logging**: View detailed logs for debugging connection issues.
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Set up alerts for resource usage or error thresholds.

## Navigating to Your Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Use the **Project Selector** in the top navigation bar to choose the project associated with your Fluency instance.
3. Use the **Navigation Menu** (hamburger icon) to access specific services like BigQuery or Vertex AI.

## Security Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum roles required for Fluency to function.
- **Resource Quotas**: Monitor quotas for APIs to prevent service interruptions during heavy usage periods.
- **Billing Alerts**: Set up budget alerts to manage your cloud infrastructure costs effectively.
