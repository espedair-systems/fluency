# Vertex AI Reference

Vertex AI is the primary machine learning platform for building, deploying, and scaling AI models within the Fluency ecosystem.

## Overview

By integrating with Google Cloud Vertex AI, Fluency provides access to state-of-the-art Generative AI models and machine learning infrastructure directly within your data workflows.

## Key Capabilities

- **Generative AI (Gemini)**: Utilize advanced LLMs for text generation, summarization, and data extraction.
- **Model Garden**: Access a wide variety of first-party, open-source, and third-party models.
- **AutoML**: Train high-quality custom models without writing code.
- **Custom Training**: Deploy your own specialized models developed in TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.

## Integration in Fluency

Vertex AI powers several intelligent features across the platform:

### Knowledge Vault Assistant
The chat interface in the Knowledge Vault uses Vertex AI models to provide context-aware answers based on your private documentation.

### Automated Labeling
Use LLMs to automatically categorize and tag incoming data streams during the **Data Prep** phase.

### Sentiment & Entity Analysis
Extract structured insights from unstructured text data using pre-trained Vertex AI APIs.

## Setup & Authentication

To enable Vertex AI:
1. Ensure your Google Cloud Project has the **Vertex AI API** enabled.
2. Configure your Service Account with the `Vertex AI User` role.
3. Add your Project ID and Region to the Fluency Integration settings.
